# Weather App

I try to learn the use of API with this project.

## Description

This is a simple weather application that fetches current weather data for a given city using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). You can enter the name of a city and get the temperature, weather condition, and location.

## Features

- Search for a city to get the current weather.
- Displays temperature in Celsius.
- Displays weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain).
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox for layout)
- JavaScript (Fetch API for backend communication)
- Node.js + Express (to securely serve the API key) --> Made by Ai becouse i dont have any understanding how Servers work yet.
